Climate Visualization Tool
This project is a web-based visualization tool for climate indicators with machine learning predictions. It allows users to input geographical coordinates and date ranges to fetch historical climate data, train a machine learning model for temperature prediction, and generate visualizations of climate indicators and precipitation over time.
